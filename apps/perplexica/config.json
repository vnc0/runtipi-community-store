  "description": "Perplexica is an intelligent AI-powered search and question-answering engine that redefines the way information is discovered and understood. Instead of providing a long list of links, it processes data from multiple sources, interprets the meaning behind each query, and generates clear, structured, and conversational responses. Every answer is designed to be both informative and contextually relevant, helping users understand complex topics without the need to sift through endless pages of search results. What makes Perplexica unique is its ability to comprehend intent rather than just keywords. When a user asks a question, it analyzes not only the literal terms but also the underlying purpose of the request. This allows it to deliver responses that feel thoughtful, connected, and natural. It synthesizes knowledge from different perspectives, combines verified information, and presents it in a way that feels like having a conversation with an expert rather than using a traditional search engine.",
